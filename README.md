In these 4 VHDL projects, we modeled designs with gradually increasing complexity in VHDL.

### Project 1
Implement a 4-bit circular barrel shifter using both structural and behavioral approaches.

### Project 2
Implement a master-slave batcher network using comparators, sorters and switches as base components.

### Project 3
Implement a floating-point number adder.

### Project 4
Implement a signed number multiplier based on Booth's multiplication algorithm.
